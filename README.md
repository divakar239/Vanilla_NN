# Vanilla_NN

## Objective:

  - In this file we will implement all the functions required to build a neural network.
  - Build a deep neural network with more than 1 hidden layer
  - Implement an easy to use neural network class
  
## Notation:
  - Superscript [l] denotes an entity associated with the l<sup>th</sup> layer of the neural network
  - Superscript (i) denotes an entity associated with the i<sup>th</sup> example
  - Lowerscript <i>i</i> denotes i<sup>th</sup> entry of a vector
  
  For example a<sub>i</sub><sup>[l]</sup> denotes the i<sup>th</sup> entry in the l<sup>th</sup> activation layer.
